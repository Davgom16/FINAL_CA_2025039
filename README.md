Intro to Programming â€“ Final Assessment

I built a simple eight-option menu-driven program in NetBeans that connects to a MySQL database. 
Each menu choice performs a specific task and prompts the user for input. 
If the user enters invalid input, the program displays an error message and returns to the main menu. 
Otherwise, it proceeds to execute the selected action.
